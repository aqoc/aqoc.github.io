You'll need to check the game log, as in the image above. If you're diagnosing a datapack, check it when you run `/reload`, if you're diagnosing a model, check it on `F3+T`. Then, if there's a syntax error, there'll probably some red error output. If you're not sure what it means, upload the log.

Steps to enable it (if the image isn't clear/doesn't load):
- Open the launcher
- Go into settings
- Ensure you're in the `General` tab
- Tick the box `Open output log when games start`
- Run the game. The log should open when you do so
